The **News App** is a simple Flutter application demonstrating a **feature-based modular architecture**.  
It is designed to keep the codebase **scalable, testable, and easy to maintain**, while remaining **lightweight** for CRUD-focused use cases.

---

## ⚙️ Setup <a id="setup"></a>

1. Install **Flutter** version `3.35.7` and **Dart** version `3.9.2`
2. Activate [Melos](https://pub.dev/packages/melos) for workspace management


---

## 🚀 Getting Started <a id="getting-started"></a>

Run the project locally:

```bash
# 1) Clone
git clone https://github.com/magamal/news_flutter.git
cd news_flutter

# 2) Bootstrap Melos workspace
melos bootstrap

# 3) Generate needed files
melos rebuild

# 4) Run the app
flutter run
```

## 🏗️ Architecture <a id="about-architecture"></a>

This architecture is designed for **CRUD-based applications** with **modular, standalone features**.
Each feature is organized as a separate module, making the project **scalable**, **maintainable**, and **easy to extend**.

### 📦 Feature-Based Modular Structure

Each feature lives inside the `features/` directory and is split into **two layers**:

```
features/                            # Root folder for all app features
├── news/                            # Example: News feature
│   ├── news_business/               # Business logic layer (repositories, data sources)
│   ├── news_presentation/           # Presentation layer (UI, Bloc, widgets)
```

> 🧩 **Each feature is standalone** and self-contained — it can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.

### 🧠 Why Only Two Layers?

* **Presentation Layer** → UI & state management (e.g., Bloc)
* **Business Layer** → Repositories & logic that interact with data sources

We intentionally **omit a dedicated Domain Layer** (entities, use cases) to keep CRUD apps simple.
The **Bloc (UI)** communicates directly with **repositories**.

### 🔗 Feature Architecture Diagram

```mermaid

    UI["👩‍🎨 Presentation Layer<br>(UI, Bloc)"]
    subgraph Repo ["⚙️ Business Layer (Repositories &amp; Logic)"]
        DB("🗄️ Local DB")
        Remote("🌐 Remote API")
    end

    UI --> Repo
    Repo --> DB
    Repo --> Remote

%% 🎨 Styling
style UI fill:#d9f2ff,stroke:#3399ff,stroke-width:2px,rx:10,ry:10
style Repo fill:#ffe6cc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,rx:10,ry:10
style DB fill:#e6f2ff,stroke:#3399ff,rx:5,ry:5
style Remote fill:#e6ffe6,stroke:#33cc33,rx:5,ry:5
```



### ✅ Benefits of This Approach

* 🔍 **Clear separation of concerns**
* 📦 **Independent feature development**
* 🚀 **Fast iteration for CRUD apps**
* 🧠 **Lower cognitive overhead** (no extra layers unless needed)
* 🧪 **Easier testing** at the feature level

---


## 🔬 Testing Strategy <a id="testing-strategy"></a>

We follow a **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** approach for testing, ensuring that tests are written in a way that reflects the actual behavior and requirements of the app.  
This allows us to validate features **end-to-end** against real user scenarios rather than just isolated units.



### ✅ Benefits of the BDD Approach

- 🧩 **Comprehensive coverage** → Ensures that all test cases align with the scenarios defined by testers and product requirements.  
- 🔄 **Easier maintenance** → Test cases remain stable even when implementation changes, since they are based on user behavior rather than code details.  
- ⚡ **Faster feature delivery** → Reduces the time needed to validate features by focusing on user flows instead of low-level code.  
- 👥 **Improved collaboration** → Provides a shared language between developers, testers, and product owners, making requirements easier to understand and verify.  



### 🧪 How We Use BDD Scenarios

We use the [bdd_widget_test](https://pub.dev/packages/bdd_widget_test) package to write scenarios and test cases.  
This library allows us to express tests in a **`Given → When → Then`** format, making them more readable and aligned with product requirements.


> 📌 With this approach, our tests act as **living documentation**, clearly describing how features are expected to behave.



### 🔺 The Testing Pyramid

We follow the **testing pyramid** principle to balance speed, confidence, and coverage:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    e2e["🧪 End-to-End (BDD Scenarios)<br>Slowest but highest confidence"]:::top
    widget["📱 Widget Tests<br>Medium speed & confidence"]:::middle
    unit["⚡ Unit Tests<br>Fastest, foundation of testing"]:::bottom

    unit --> widget --> e2e

classDef top fill:#ffdddd,stroke:#d33,stroke-width:2px
classDef middle fill:#fff4cc,stroke:#e6a700,stroke-width:2px
classDef bottom fill:#ddffdd,stroke:#339933,stroke-width:2px
```

* **Unit Tests** → Validate individual classes, functions, or blocs.
* **Widget Tests** → Validate UI components and widget interactions.
* **BDD (End-to-End) Tests** → Validate full user scenarios across layers.

### 📂 Where to Find Tests

To keep things organized, tests are structured alongside features and core modules:<br>
you could find the bdd test cases and scenarios in every **feature_presentation** module in **test** folder

```
features/                            # 
├── news/                            # Feature folder
│   ├── news_business/               # 
│   ├── news_presentation/           # Presentation layer (UI, Bloc, widgets)
│   │   ├──test                      # Bdd test cases and scenarios
```

### 🚀 Running Tests

Run all BDD tests in all **presentation modules**:

```bash
melos test
```
